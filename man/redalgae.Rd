\usage{data(redalgae)}
\details{
  Red algae fossil diversity since the Jurassic compiled from the Neptune Database (Lazarus, 1994) and Paleobiology Database (https://paleobiodb.org/). Diversity curves are estimated at the genus level using shareholder quorum subsampling (Alroy, 2010) at two-million-year bins. The format is a dataframe with the two following variables:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{age}}{a numeric vector corresponding to the geological age, in Myrs before the present}
    \item{\code{redalgae}}{a numeric vector corresponding to the estimated Red algae change at that age}
  }
